title: Enforce match_arm_blocks = true for consistent formatting

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      Flips `match_arm_blocks` from `false` to `true` in rustfmt configuration to ensure
      all multi-line match arm bodies are wrapped in braces consistently.

      This is a formatting-only change with no functional impact. It enforces a single
      valid style for match arms, eliminating ambiguity that caused unnecessary diffs
      when LLMs generated code with braces.
