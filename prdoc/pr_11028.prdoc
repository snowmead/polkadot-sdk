    # Description

    Add `DecodeWithMemTracking` derive to `CompactProof` in `substrate/primitives/trie/src/storage_proof.rs`.

    `StorageProof` already derived `DecodeWithMemTracking` but `CompactProof` in the same file was missed.

    ## Integration

    No integration changes required for downstream projects. `CompactProof` now implements `DecodeWithMemTracking`, which is a strictly additive trait implementation. Existing code using `CompactProof` will continue to work as before.

    ## Review Notes

    Single-line change adding `DecodeWithMemTracking` to the derive macro list on `CompactProof`:

    ```diff
    -#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)]
    +#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Encode, Decode, DecodeWithMemTracking, TypeInfo)]
     pub struct CompactProof {
         pub encoded_nodes: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
     }
    ```

    `CompactProof` only contains `Vec<Vec<u8>>`, which already implements `DecodeWithMemTracking`, so the derive works without any manual implementation.
