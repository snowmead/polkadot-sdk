# Change Unit Analysis: PR #8400 - Fix assert_expected_events Macro

## Overview

- **Type**: Testing Framework Fix
- **Component**: XCM Emulator Testing (`xcm-emulator` crate)
- **Severity**: Low-to-Medium Breaking Change
- **Links**: [PR #8400](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400)

## Summary

Fixed the `assert_expected_events!` macro in xcm-emulator to properly fail when expected events are missing, instead of silently passing. This change improves test reliability but may cause previously passing tests to fail.

## Technical Details

### Code Changes
- **File**: `/cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator/src/lib.rs`
- **Macro**: `assert_expected_events!` (lines 1254-1334)
- **Change**: Added strict event validation logic

```rust
// Before: Silently passed when events were missing
// After: Fails with detailed error message when events are missing

if event_received && !meet_conditions {
    // Event found but conditions not met
    message.push(/* detailed condition failure message */);
} else if !event_received {
    // Event never received - THIS NOW FAILS (was silently ignored before)
    message.push(/* detailed missing event message */);
} else {
    // Perfect match - remove event to avoid duplicate matching
    events.remove(index_match);
}
```

### Affected Components
- All parachains using xcm-emulator for integration testing
- Asset Hub, Bridge Hub, Coretime, People parachain tests
- Custom parachain test suites using the macro

## Impact Analysis

### Breaking Changes
- **Test Behavior**: Tests that were silently passing may now fail
- **API Compatibility**: No API changes - macro signature remains identical
- **Runtime Logic**: No impact on runtime execution

### Migration Steps
1. **Run existing test suite** to identify newly failing tests
2. **Analyze failures** to determine if they indicate:
   - Real bugs in runtime logic
   - Incorrect test expectations
   - Missing event emissions
3. **Update tests** to fix expectations or runtime logic

### Example Migration
```rust
// If this test now fails:
assert_expected_events!(
    MyChain,
    vec![
        RuntimeEvent::NonExistentEvent { data: expected_data } => {},
    ]
);

// Options to fix:
// 1. Fix runtime to emit the expected event
// 2. Update test expectations to match actual behavior
// 3. Remove assertions for events that shouldn't be expected
```

## Risks and Benefits

### Benefits
- **Improved Test Reliability**: Tests now actually verify expected behavior
- **Bug Detection**: Hidden issues in event emission will be caught
- **Better Debugging**: Detailed error messages show what events were emitted vs expected

### Risks
- **Test Suite Breakage**: Existing tests may fail and require updates
- **Development Workflow**: May temporarily slow development until tests are fixed
- **False Positives**: Some tests may fail due to overly strict expectations

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **High Priority**: Update test suites after adopting this change
2. **Review Process**: Categorize test failures by type (real bugs vs test issues)
3. **Team Coordination**: Plan for brief test fixing period

### Long-term Benefits
- More reliable and trustworthy test suite
- Better confidence in runtime behavior verification
- Improved debugging capabilities for XCM interactions
