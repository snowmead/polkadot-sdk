## Release Summary

This is a patch release for stable2503 addressing critical performance issues and testing framework reliability. The release contains 31 commits and focuses on two main areas:

1. **Performance Critical**: Fixes network-wide parachain block time issues affecting the entire Polkadot ecosystem
2. **Testing Framework**: Improves reliability of XCM emulator testing with stricter event validation

## Implementation Checklist

### üõ°Ô∏è Critical Performance Fix
- [ ] **PR #8447**: Apply dispute distribution performance fix
  - **Impact**: Fixes network-wide slow parachain blocks
  - **Action**: Upgrade immediately - automatic improvement
  - **Monitoring**: Track block times and backing points post-upgrade
  - **Expected**: ~12s block times, reduced flooding errors

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing Framework Changes  
- [ ] **PR #8400**: Update for stricter event assertion behavior
  - **Impact**: `assert_expected_events!` macro now fails on missing events
  - **Action**: Run test suite, fix newly failing tests
  - **Risk**: Previously passing tests may now fail
  - **Benefit**: More reliable test validation

### üìã Updated Crates
- [ ] **polkadot-dispute-distribution**: v22.1.0 (major version bump)
- [ ] **xcm-emulator**: v0.19.2 (testing framework fix)

### üîß Docker Images  
- [ ] Update to `parity/polkadot:stable2503-2`
- [ ] Update to `parity/polkadot-parachain:stable2503-2`

## Detailed Change Analysis

### üõ°Ô∏è CRITICAL: Performance Fix (PR #8447)

**Problem**: Network-wide parachain performance degradation since May 3, 2025
- Block times exceeding 25 seconds (normal ~12s)  
- 15% drop in validator backing points
- Widespread AuthorityFlooding errors

**Solution**: Remove unnecessary reputation penalty in dispute distribution
```rust
// Before: Applied reputation penalty
reputation_changes: vec![COST_APPARENT_FLOOD]

// After: No reputation penalty  
reputation_changes: vec![]
```

**Impact for Fork Maintainers**:
- ‚úÖ **Immediate benefit**: Automatic performance improvement
- ‚úÖ **No migration required**: Transparent fix for node operators
- ‚úÖ **Resource efficiency**: Reduced CPU overhead in dispute processing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitor required**: Track effectiveness post-deployment

**Migration Steps**:
1. Upgrade to stable2503-2
2. Monitor parachain block times (target: ~12s)
3. Check for reduced flooding errors in logs
4. Track backing point improvements

### ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPERIMENTAL: Testing Framework Enhancement (PR #8400)

**Problem**: `assert_expected_events!` macro silently passed when expected events were missing

**Solution**: Added strict event validation with proper failure reporting

**Impact for Fork Maintainers**:
- üî¥ **Breaking for tests**: Previously passing tests may now fail
- ‚úÖ **Improved reliability**: Tests now actually verify expected behavior  
- ‚úÖ **Better debugging**: Detailed error messages for missing events
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Team coordination**: Plan for test fixing period

**Migration Steps**:
1. Run existing test suite after upgrade
2. Analyze any newly failing tests:
   - Real bugs ‚Üí Fix runtime logic to emit expected events
   - Test issues ‚Üí Update expectations to match actual behavior
   - Over-assertion ‚Üí Remove incorrect event assertions
3. Update team testing practices for stricter validation

**Example Test Fix**:
```rust
// This test may now fail if events are missing:
assert_expected_events!(
    MyChain,
    vec![
        RuntimeEvent::Transfer { from, to, amount } => {
            from: from == &ALICE,
            to: to == &BOB,
            amount: amount == &100,
        },
    ]
);

// Ensure your runtime actually emits this event, or
// Update test expectations to match actual behavior
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Deploy performance fix**: Upgrade all nodes to address critical block time issues
2. **Test suite validation**: Run integration tests to identify framework changes
3. **Performance monitoring**: Track metrics post-upgrade to verify improvements

### Medium-term Actions  
1. **Test framework training**: Update team practices for stricter event validation
2. **Performance baseline**: Establish new performance metrics and alerting
3. **Upstream tracking**: Monitor for additional performance optimizations

### Long-term Considerations
1. This performance fix is **incremental** - additional optimizations may be released
2. Enhanced testing framework requires **ongoing vigilance** for test reliability
3. **Stay updated** on related performance and testing improvements from upstream
