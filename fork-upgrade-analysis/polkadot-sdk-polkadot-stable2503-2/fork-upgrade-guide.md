  - Related: [Issue #8414](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/8414)
  - Component: `Polkadot Core - Reputation System`
  - Impact: High
  - Flags: ⚠️ CRITICAL

- [ ] **[#8400](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400)**: make assert_expected_events fail on missing event → [📄 Analysis](pr-8400/analysis.md)

## 🔥 Critical Priority Items

### Immediate Action Required: PR #8447
This change addresses **severe parachain performance issues** where block times exceeded 25 seconds network-wide. Deploy this fix immediately as it:
- Removes problematic reputation mechanism causing validator flooding
- Fixes "AuthorityFlooding" errors affecting validator operations
- Improves parachain block time consistency
- **Note**: This is a partial fix - continued monitoring for root cause is essential

## 🧪 Testing Framework Updates

### PR #8400 - Enhanced Test Validation
This change makes the `assert_expected_events!` macro stricter by failing when expected events are missing. Existing tests may need review to ensure they actually produce expected events.

## 🚨 Post-Upgrade Monitoring

After implementing these changes:

1. **Monitor parachain block times** - Should return to 6-12 second ranges
2. **Check validator logs** - "AuthorityFlooding" errors should decrease significantly  
3. **Review test results** - Some tests using `assert_expected_events!` may now fail and need fixing
4. **Track performance metrics** - Establish new baselines for network performance
