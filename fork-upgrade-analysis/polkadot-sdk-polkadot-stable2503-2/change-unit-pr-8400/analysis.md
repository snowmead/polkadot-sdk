# Change Unit: assert_expected_events macro fix to properly check event was received

## Overview
- **Type**: Bug Fix
- **Component**: XCM Emulator Testing Framework
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Primary Item**: [PR #8400](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400)
- **Related Items**: None

## Summary
Fixed a critical bug in the `assert_expected_events!` macro in the XCM emulator testing framework where the macro would incorrectly pass tests even when expected events were not received. This fix ensures that tests fail when expected events are missing, improving test reliability and preventing false positives in XCM integration tests.

### PR #8400: assert_expected_events macro fix to properly check event was received
**URL**: [https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400)
**Role**: Primary implementation

## Technical Details

### Changes Made
- Modified the `assert_expected_events!` macro in [`cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator/src/lib.rs:1311-1322`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator/src/lib.rs#L1311-L1322)
- Added explicit failure when expected events are not received
- Enhanced error messaging to show all events when expected event is missing

### Code Examples
```rust
// Before: Macro would pass even if no event was received
if event_received && !meet_conditions  {
    message.push(
        format!(
            "\n\n{}::\x1b[31m{}\x1b[0m was received but some of its attributes did not meet the conditions:\n{}",
            stringify!($chain),
            stringify!($event_pat),
            event_message.concat()
        )
    );
}
// Missing: No check for !event_received case

// After: Explicit check for missing events
if event_received && !meet_conditions  {
    message.push(
        format!(
            "\n\n{}::\x1b[31m{}\x1b[0m was received but some of its attributes did not meet the conditions:\n{}",
            stringify!($chain),
            stringify!($event_pat),
            event_message.concat()
        )
    );
} else if !event_received {
    message.push(
        format!(
            "\n\n{}::\x1b[31m{}\x1b[0m was never received. All events:\n{:#?}",
            stringify!($chain),
            stringify!($event_pat),
            <$chain as $crate::Chain>::events(),
        )
    );
}
```

### Problem Addressed
The original macro had a logical flaw where it only checked for events that were received but didn't meet conditions. If an expected event was never emitted, the macro would silently pass, leading to false positive test results. This could mask real bugs in XCM message processing.

### Example of Fixed Test Case
```rust
// This test would incorrectly pass before the fix
assert_expected_events!(
    AssetHubRococo,
    vec![
        RuntimeEvent::MessageQueue(
            pallet_message_queue::Event::Processed { success: true, .. }
        ) => {},
    ]
);
// Now correctly fails if the MessageQueue::Processed event is never emitted
```

## Impact Analysis

### Breaking Changes
None - This is a bug fix that improves test accuracy without changing public APIs.

### Migration Requirements
No migration required. Existing tests may start failing if they were previously passing due to this bug, which is the intended behavior.

### Dependencies
No new dependencies or version changes required.

## Testing Considerations

### Areas to Test
- Run existing XCM integration tests to identify any that were previously passing incorrectly
- Verify that tests now fail appropriately when expected events are missing
- Confirm that tests still pass when all expected events are properly emitted

### Expected Test Failures
Some integration tests that were previously passing due to this bug may now fail, which indicates the tests need to be updated to match actual runtime behavior.

## Risks and Benefits

### Benefits
- **Improved Test Reliability**: Tests now accurately reflect whether expected events were emitted
- **Better Bug Detection**: Previously hidden bugs in XCM message processing will now be caught
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Clear error messages show all events when expected event is missing
- **False Positive Prevention**: Eliminates scenarios where tests pass when they should fail

### Risks
- **Test Suite Disruption**: Some existing tests may start failing and require updates
- **Development Workflow Impact**: Developers may need to investigate and fix newly failing tests
- **Minimal Runtime Risk**: This is a testing-only change with no runtime impact

## Recommendations

### For Fork Maintainers
1. **Apply This Fix**: This is a critical testing infrastructure improvement that should be adopted
2. **Test Suite Audit**: After applying the fix, run your complete test suite and investigate any newly failing tests
3. **Update Failing Tests**: For tests that start failing after this fix:
   - Investigate whether the test expectation or the runtime behavior is incorrect
   - Update test expectations if the runtime behavior is correct
   - Fix runtime bugs if the test expectations are correct
4. **Verify Event Emission**: Ensure your XCM integration tests are checking for the correct events
5. **Documentation Update**: Update any testing documentation to reflect the improved behavior

### Implementation Priority
**High** - This fix improves the reliability of the entire XCM testing framework and should be prioritized to prevent accumulation of false positive tests.

### Testing Strategy
1. Apply the fix in a development environment first
2. Run the complete test suite and document failing tests
3. Analyze each failure to determine if it's a test issue or runtime bug
4. Address identified issues before deploying to production branches
