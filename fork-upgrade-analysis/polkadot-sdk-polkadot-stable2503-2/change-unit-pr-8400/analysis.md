## Overview
- **Type**: Bug Fix
- **Component**: XCM Emulator Testing Framework

## Technical Details

### Changes Made
- Modified [`cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator/src/lib.rs#L1255-L1334): Updated the `assert_expected_events!` macro logic
- Enhanced event matching condition to properly fail when expected events are missing

### Problem Description
The original issue was in the `assert_expected_events!` macro's conditional logic. When testing for events like this:

```rust
assert_expected_events!(
    AssetHubRococo,
    vec![
        RuntimeEvent::MessageQueue(
            pallet_message_queue::Event::Processed { success: true, .. }
        ) => {},
    ]
);
```

The test would pass even if no matching event was found in the events list, which is incorrect behavior for a testing assertion.

### Code Implementation

The fix involved updating the failure condition logic in the macro. The current implementation (post-fix) shows:

```rust
// Current (fixed) implementation
if event_received && !meet_conditions  {
    message.push(
        format!(
            "\n\n{}::\x1b[31m{}\x1b[0m was received but some of its attributes did not meet the conditions:\n{}",
            stringify!($chain),
            stringify!($event_pat),
            event_message.concat()
        )
    );
} else if !event_received {
    message.push(
        format!(
            "\n\n{}::\x1b[31m{}\x1b[0m was never received. All events:\n{:#?}",
            stringify!($chain),
            stringify!($event_pat),
            <$chain as $crate::Chain>::events(),
        )
    );
} else {
    // Perfect match found - remove event to avoid duplicate assessment
    events.remove(index_match);
}

if !message.is_empty() {
    // Log events and panic on failure
    <$chain as $crate::Chain>::events().iter().for_each(|event| {
        $crate::log::info!(target: concat!("events::", stringify!($chain)), "{:?}", event);
    });
    panic!("{}", message.concat())
}
```

The key aspects of the fix:
1. **Proper failure detection**: The `!event_received` condition ensures tests fail when expected events are missing
2. **Clear error messages**: Provides detailed feedback about which events were not received
3. **Comprehensive logging**: Logs all events before panicking to aid debugging

## Impact Analysis

### Breaking Changes
None - This is a pure bug fix that corrects testing behavior without changing APIs.

### Migration Requirements
No migration required. This fix improves existing test reliability but doesn't change the macro's interface.

### Dependencies
No new dependencies or version changes required.

## Testing Considerations

### Test Scenarios to Verify:
1. **Missing Events**: Confirm that tests now properly fail when expected events are not emitted
2. **Partial Matches**: Verify that events matching the pattern but failing conditions are properly reported
3. **Perfect Matches**: Ensure tests still pass when events are correctly received and meet all conditions
4. **Multiple Event Patterns**: Test behavior with multiple expected events in a single assertion

### Example Test Cases:
```rust
// Should now FAIL (previously would pass incorrectly)
assert_expected_events!(
    TestChain,
    vec![
        RuntimeEvent::NonExistentPallet(Event::NeverEmitted) => {},
    ]
);

// Should continue to PASS
assert_expected_events!(
    TestChain,
    vec![
        RuntimeEvent::System(frame_system::Event::ExtrinsicSuccess { .. }) => {},
    ]
);
```

## Risks and Benefits

### Benefits
- **Improved Test Reliability**: Tests now correctly fail when expected events are missing, preventing false positives
- **Better Debugging**: Enhanced error messages help developers quickly identify missing events
- **Maintained Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing test code
- **Framework Integrity**: Restores confidence in the XCM emulator testing framework

### Risks
- **Potential Test Failures**: Existing tests that were incorrectly passing may now fail, requiring investigation
- **Low Implementation Risk**: The fix is localized to assertion logic with minimal complexity

## Recommendations

### For Fork Maintainers:
1. **Apply Immediately**: This is a critical testing infrastructure fix that should be prioritized
2. **Review Existing Tests**: Audit current test suites for any tests that may have been incorrectly passing
3. **Validate Event Assertions**: Ensure all XCM-related tests properly emit expected events
4. **Update Test Documentation**: Consider documenting proper usage patterns for `assert_expected_events!`

### Migration Steps:
1. Apply the fix to the `assert_expected_events!` macro
2. Run existing test suites to identify any newly failing tests
3. Investigate and fix any tests that were incorrectly passing due to missing events
4. No code changes required in test usage - only the macro implementation changes

This fix is essential for maintaining test suite integrity and should be treated as a high-priority bug fix rather than a feature enhancement.
