# Change Unit: assert_expected_events macro fix to properly check event was received

## Overview
- **Type**: Bug Fix
- **Component**: Testing Infrastructure / Macros
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Primary Item**: [PR #8400](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400)
- **Related Items**: None

## Summary
This change fixes a critical bug in the `assert_expected_events!` macro where tests would silently pass even when expected events were not found. The macro now properly fails when no event matches the specified pattern, preventing false positive test results that could mask actual issues in event emission.

## Items in This Change Unit

### PR #8400: make assert_expected_events fail on missing event
**URL**: [https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400)
**Role**: Primary implementation
**Author**: karolk91
**Reviewers**: serban300, acatangiu, x3c41a (all approved)
**Labels**: A4-backport-stable2503, R0-silent, T10-tests

## Technical Details

### Changes Made
- Modified the `assert_expected_events!` macro implementation to fail when no matching event is found
- The macro previously would silently pass when no event matched the specified pattern
- Now ensures test failures when expected events are missing from the event vector

### Code Examples
```rust
// Example usage that was previously passing incorrectly:
assert_expected_events!(
    AssetHubRococo,
    vec![
        RuntimeEvent::MessageQueue(
            pallet_message_queue::Event::Processed { success: true, .. }
        ) => {},
    ]
);
```

**Before**: This test would pass even if no `MessageQueue::Processed` event was emitted.

**After**: This test now correctly fails if the expected event is not found in the event vector.

## Impact Analysis

### Breaking Changes
- **Potential test failures**: Tests that were previously passing due to missing events may now fail
- This is actually the intended behavior - the "breaking" change fixes incorrect test behavior
- Tests relying on the old (incorrect) behavior will need to be fixed

### Migration Requirements
**Action Required**: Review and update existing tests that use `assert_expected_events!`

1. **Audit existing tests**: Check all usages of `assert_expected_events!` macro
2. **Fix false positives**: Update tests that were incorrectly passing due to missing events
3. **Verify event emission**: Ensure that code under test actually emits the expected events
4. **Test validation**: Run the full test suite to identify any newly failing tests

### Dependencies
- No new dependencies introduced
- No version changes required
- Change is contained within the testing macro implementation

## Testing Considerations
- **Immediate testing**: Run all existing tests using `assert_expected_events!` to identify failures
- **Regression testing**: Verify that the macro correctly fails when events are missing
- **Positive testing**: Confirm that the macro still passes when expected events are present
- **Edge cases**: Test with empty event vectors and multiple expected events

## Risks and Benefits

### Benefits
- **Improved test reliability**: Eliminates false positive test results
- **Better debugging**: Test failures now accurately reflect missing events
- **Enhanced confidence**: Tests provide more reliable validation of event emission
- **Prevents masking issues**: Previously hidden bugs may now surface through proper test failures

### Risks
- **Initial test suite disruption**: Some tests may start failing after the fix
- **Development workflow impact**: Developers need to investigate and fix newly failing tests
- **False alarm potential**: Need to distinguish between legitimate fixes and actual regressions

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate action**: Apply this fix as it corrects fundamental testing infrastructure
2. **Test audit**: Conduct a comprehensive review of all `assert_expected_events!` usage
3. **Gradual rollout**: Consider applying this change in a controlled manner to manage test failures
4. **Documentation update**: Update testing guidelines to reflect the corrected macro behavior
5. **Team communication**: Inform development teams about the change and potential test impacts
6. **Monitoring**: Track test failure patterns to identify systematic issues vs. individual test problems

**Priority**: High - This fix is essential for maintaining test integrity and should be applied promptly, with proper preparation for handling the resulting test failures.
