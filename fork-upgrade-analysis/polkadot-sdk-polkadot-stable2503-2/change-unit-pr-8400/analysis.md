# Change Unit: assert_expected_events macro fix to properly check event was received

## Overview
- **Type**: Bug Fix
- **Component**: Testing Infrastructure / Event Assertion Macros
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Primary Item**: [PR #8400](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400)
- **Related Items**: None

## Summary
This PR fixes a critical issue in the `assert_expected_events` macro where tests would silently pass even when expected events were not generated. The fix ensures that tests properly fail when an expected event is missing, improving test reliability and catching potential runtime issues.

## Items in This Change Unit

### PR #8400: assert_expected_events macro fix to properly check event was received
**URL**: [https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400)
**Role**: Primary implementation

## Technical Details

### Changes Made
The PR modifies the `assert_expected_events` macro implementation to ensure that:
- Tests fail when expected events are not found in the event queue
- Event pattern matching is more strict and reliable
- Silent test passes are eliminated when events are missing

### Code Examples
```rust
// Usage example (no change in syntax)
assert_expected_events!(
    AssetHubRococo,
    vec![
        RuntimeEvent::MessageQueue(
            pallet_message_queue::Event::Processed { success: true, .. }
        ) => {},
    ]
);
```

**Before**: The macro would pass even if no matching event was found
**After**: The macro fails appropriately when expected events are missing

## Impact Analysis

### Breaking Changes
None - this is a pure bug fix that maintains the same API interface.

### Migration Requirements
No migration required. Existing test code continues to work with the same syntax, but may now properly fail if events are not being generated as expected.

### Dependencies
No new dependencies or version changes required.

## Testing Considerations
- **Immediate Impact**: Some existing tests that were silently passing due to missing events may now fail appropriately
- **Test Review**: Fork maintainers should review any newly failing tests to determine if:
  - The test logic needs adjustment
  - There are actual runtime issues causing missing events
  - Event generation patterns have changed

## Risks and Benefits

### Benefits
- **Improved Test Reliability**: Tests now properly catch missing events
- **Bug Detection**: Helps identify runtime issues where expected events are not generated
- **Developer Experience**: Provides clearer feedback when event assertions fail

### Risks
- **Test Breakage**: Some existing tests may start failing if they were relying on the buggy behavior
- **False Positives**: Developers may need to investigate newly failing tests to distinguish between test issues and actual bugs

## Recommendations

1. **Test Suite Review**: After applying this change, run the full test suite and investigate any newly failing event assertion tests

2. **Event Generation Audit**: For any failing tests, verify that:
   - Expected events are actually being generated by the runtime
   - Event patterns in tests match the actual event structure
   - No breaking changes in event definitions have occurred

3. **Continuous Integration**: Ensure CI pipelines catch these improved assertions to prevent regressions

4. **Documentation**: Update any testing documentation to reflect the more strict event assertion behavior

5. **Backport Consideration**: Since this is backported to stable2503, ensure compatibility with existing stable branch test expectations

This change represents a quality improvement to the testing infrastructure that should be adopted to maintain robust test coverage and catch potential runtime issues early.
