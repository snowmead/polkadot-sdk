# Change Unit: make assert_expected_events fail on missing event

## Overview
- Type: Enhancement
- Component: xcm-emulator testing framework
- Severity: Medium
- Primary: [#8400](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400)
- Related: None

## Summary
This change enhances the `assert_expected_events!` macro in the xcm-emulator crate to fail when expected events are missing from the event list. Previously, the macro would pass even when no matching events were found, leading to potentially unreliable tests. This improvement ensures stricter event validation and better test reliability.

## Items in This Change Unit
- [PR #8400](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400) - Primary implementation for making assert_expected_events fail on missing events

## Technical Details
- **Changes**: Modifies the `assert_expected_events!` macro in the xcm-emulator crate
- **Implementation**: Updates macro logic to explicitly fail when expected events are not found in the event list
- **Code Examples**: 
  ```rust
  // Before: This would pass even if no matching event exists
  assert_expected_events!(
      AssetHubRococo,
      vec![
          RuntimeEvent::MessageQueue(
              pallet_message_queue::Event::Processed { success: true, .. }
          ) => {},
      ]
  );
  
  // After: This will now fail if the expected event is not found
  // Same syntax, but stricter validation behavior
  ```

## Impact Analysis
- **Breaking Changes**: Minimal - existing syntax remains the same, but behavior becomes stricter
- **Migration**: Tests that were previously passing due to lenient behavior may now fail and need fixing
- **Dependencies**: No external dependency changes required

## Testing Considerations
- Existing tests using `assert_expected_events!` macro should be reviewed to ensure they actually produce the expected events
- Tests that were silently passing due to missing events will now fail and need to be corrected
- Consider adding unit tests for the macro itself to validate the new failure behavior
- Test scenarios where events are intentionally missing to verify proper failure handling

## Risks and Benefits
**Benefits:**
- Improved test reliability and accuracy
- Earlier detection of missing events in test scenarios
- More precise event validation in xcm-emulator tests
- Prevents false positives in test results

**Risks:**
- Existing tests may break if they were relying on the previous lenient behavior
- Potential for increased test maintenance overhead initially
- Need to review and potentially fix existing test suites

## Recommendations
**For fork maintainers:**
1. **Test Review**: Thoroughly review all existing tests using `assert_expected_events!` macro to ensure they produce the expected events
2. **Gradual Migration**: Consider implementing this change in a controlled manner, possibly with a feature flag initially
3. **Documentation**: Update test documentation to reflect the new stricter behavior
4. **Test Coverage**: Add comprehensive tests for edge cases where events might be missing
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor test failures after integration to identify tests that need updating
6. **Training**: Ensure development teams understand the new stricter validation behavior

This enhancement significantly improves the reliability of the xcm-emulator testing framework by preventing silent failures and ensuring that event assertions actually validate the presence of expected events.
