# Change Unit: Fix a potential cause of slow parachain blocks

## Overview
- **Type**: Performance
- **Component**: Dispute Distribution Network Layer
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Primary Item**: [PR #8447](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8447)
- **Related Items**: None

## Summary
This change removes unnecessary reputation penalties in the dispute distribution system that were potentially contributing to slower parachain block times on Polkadot. The fix eliminates useless reputation changes that added overhead without providing meaningful network protection benefits.

## Items in This Change Unit

### PR #8447: Drop useless rep change
**URL**: [https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8447](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8447)
**Role**: Primary implementation

## Technical Details

### Changes Made
- **[polkadot/node/network/dispute-distribution/src/receiver/mod.rs](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8447/files#diff-1)**: Removed `COST_APPARENT_FLOOD` reputation penalties in two locations
- **[polkadot/node/network/dispute-distribution/src/tests/mod.rs](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8447/files#diff-2)**: Updated test cases to reflect removal of reputation changes
- **[prdoc/pr_8447.prdoc](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8447/files#diff-3)**: Added documentation for the change

### Code Examples
```rust
// Before - in receiver/mod.rs
Ok(PendingResponse {
    sent_request: req,
    response_receiver: response_receiver.boxed(),
    reputation_changes: vec![COST_APPARENT_FLOOD],
})

// After - in receiver/mod.rs
Ok(PendingResponse {
    sent_request: req,
    response_receiver: response_receiver.boxed(),
    reputation_changes: vec![],
})
```

The change removes the `COST_APPARENT_FLOOD` reputation penalty which was being applied unnecessarily, potentially causing performance degradation during dispute distribution processing.

## Impact Analysis

### Breaking Changes
None

### Migration Requirements
No migration required - this is an internal optimization that removes unnecessary reputation penalties.

### Dependencies
No new dependencies or version changes.

## Testing Considerations
- Verify that parachain block times improve after applying this fix
- Ensure dispute distribution mechanism continues to function correctly without the removed reputation penalties
- Monitor network behavior to confirm no regression in spam protection
- Test scenarios with high dispute activity to ensure performance improvements

## Risks and Benefits

### Benefits
- **Performance Improvement**: Removes computational overhead from unnecessary reputation calculations
- **Faster Block Times**: Reduces latency in parachain block processing
- **Network Efficiency**: Eliminates redundant reputation penalties that weren't providing value
- **Simplified Code Path**: Cleaner logic without useless reputation changes

### Risks
- **Potential Spam Vulnerability**: Removing reputation penalties might theoretically reduce spam protection, though the original penalties were deemed ineffective
- **Behavioral Changes**: Network participants might behave slightly differently without these reputation signals
- **Monitoring Required**: Need to observe network behavior to ensure no negative side effects

## Recommendations
1. **Apply Immediately**: This is a low-risk performance optimization that should be applied to improve parachain block times
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track block time metrics before and after deployment to measure improvement
3. **Watch for Spam**: Monitor for any increase in malicious network behavior, though risk is low since the removed penalties were ineffective
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate in test environments that dispute distribution continues working as expected
5. **Consider Backporting**: This fix is already marked for backport to stable2503, which is appropriate given the performance benefits

## Additional Context
- This change was developed in response to issue [#8414](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/8414) regarding "Slow and Inconsistent Block Times"
- The reputation change was identified as "not the root cause of the block time issue, but certainly not helping"
- Multiple reviewers (AndreiEres, sandreim, lexnv) approved the changes
- Successfully merged and backported to stable release branches
