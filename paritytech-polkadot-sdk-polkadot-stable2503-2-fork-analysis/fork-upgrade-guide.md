### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- [ ] **[#8400](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400)**: make assert_expected_events fail on missing event → [📄 Analysis](./change-unit-pr-8400/analysis.md)
  - Component: `xcm-emulator testing framework`
  - Impact: Medium
  - Note: May cause previously passing tests to fail (this is good - they were broken)

### 🚀 Performance Improvements
- [ ] **[#8447](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8447)**: Drop useless rep change → [📄 Analysis](./change-unit-pr-8447/analysis.md)
  - Related: [#8414](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/8414)
  - Component: `polkadot-dispute-distribution`
  - Impact: Medium
  - Note: Addresses slow parachain block times

### 🎯 Key Points for This Release

1. **PR #8400 (Test Framework Fix)**:
   - ✅ **Recommended**: Critical testing improvement that catches real bugs
   - ⚠️ **Expect**: Some existing tests may start failing (this is good - investigate these failures)
   - 🔧 **Action**: Run full test suite and fix any newly failing tests

2. **PR #8447 (Performance Fix)**:
   - ✅ **Recommended**: Valuable performance optimization for parachain blocks  
   - 📈 **Benefit**: Should improve parachain block processing times
   - 📊 **Action**: Monitor dispute processing metrics after deployment

### 🧪 Testing Strategy

1. **Before Integration**: 
   - Run current test suite to establish baseline
   - Document any existing test failures

2. **After PR #8400**:
   - Expect some new test failures from the improved macro
   - Investigate each failure - they likely indicate real bugs
   - Fix the underlying issues, don't just update test expectations

3. **After PR #8447**:
   - Monitor parachain block times and dispute processing metrics
   - Watch for any new rate limiting issues
   - Verify network stability is maintained

### 🚨 Risk Mitigation

- **Test Framework Changes**: The test macro fix will surface real issues - treat new failures as bug discoveries
- **Performance Changes**: Monitor dispute distribution carefully for any unexpected behavior
- **Network Effects**: Watch for any changes in peer behavior after reputation penalty removal
