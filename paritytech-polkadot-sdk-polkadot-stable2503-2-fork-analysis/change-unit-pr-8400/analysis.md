# Change Unit: assert_expected_events macro fix

## Overview
- **Type**: Bug Fix
- **Component**: XCM Emulator Testing Framework
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Primary Item**: [PR #8400](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400): make assert_expected_events fail on missing event
- **Related Items**: None

## Summary
PR #8400 fixes a critical flaw in the `assert_expected_events!` macro within the xcm-emulator testing framework. Previously, the macro would silently pass when expected events were missing, potentially allowing broken tests to appear successful. This change makes the macro properly fail when expected events are not found, improving test reliability and catching actual bugs.

### PR #8400: make assert_expected_events fail on missing event
**URL**: [https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8400)
**Role**: Primary implementation

## Technical Details

### Changes Made
- [cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator/src/lib.rs:1254-1334](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator/src/lib.rs#L1254-L1334): Modified `assert_expected_events!` macro behavior
- Enhanced event matching logic to ensure tests fail when expected events are missing
- Improved error reporting to provide clearer feedback when assertions fail

### Code Examples
```rust
// Before: Macro would silently pass if no events matched the pattern
assert_expected_events!(
    Chain,
    vec![
        RuntimeEvent::SomeEvent { success: true } => {},
    ]
);
// If SomeEvent was never emitted, test would still pass

// After: Macro now properly fails with descriptive error message
assert_expected_events!(
    Chain,
    vec![
        RuntimeEvent::SomeEvent { success: true } => {},
    ]
);
// If SomeEvent is never emitted, test will fail with clear error message
// showing all actual events that were emitted
```

### Macro Implementation Analysis
The `assert_expected_events!` macro in `/home/runner/work/polkadot-sdk/polkadot-sdk/cumulus/xcm/xcm-emulator/src/lib.rs` (lines 1254-1334) performs the following logic:

1. **Event Matching Loop**: Iterates through all events to find pattern matches
2. **Condition Checking**: Validates attribute conditions for matched events  
3. **State Tracking**: Uses flags `event_received` and `meet_conditions` to track match status
4. **Error Reporting**: Generates descriptive error messages for different failure scenarios
5. **Event Removal**: Removes successfully matched events to prevent duplicate matching

The fix ensures that when `event_received` is false (no matching event pattern found), the macro fails with a comprehensive error message showing all actual events.

## Impact Analysis

### Breaking Changes
None - This is a test infrastructure improvement that makes tests more accurate without changing runtime behavior.

### Migration Requirements
No migration required for runtime code. However, **test suites may need updates** if they contain tests that were previously passing incorrectly due to missing events.

### Dependencies
No new dependencies introduced. The change is isolated to the xcm-emulator testing framework.

## Testing Considerations
- **Existing Test Suites**: Review existing integration tests using `assert_expected_events!` to ensure they properly emit expected events
- **Test Failure Investigation**: Tests that start failing after this change likely indicate real issues where expected events weren't being emitted
- **Error Message Clarity**: The enhanced error messages will help debug test failures more effectively

## Risks and Benefits

### Benefits
- **Improved Test Reliability**: Tests will now properly fail when events are missing, catching real bugs
- **Better Debugging**: Enhanced error messages show all actual events when assertions fail
- **Test Quality**: Prevents false positives in test suites that could mask real issues
- **Development Confidence**: More reliable testing infrastructure leads to better code quality

### Risks
- **Test Suite Disruption**: Existing tests that were silently passing may now fail, requiring investigation and fixes
- **Development Friction**: Teams may need to spend time fixing newly failing tests
- **Backward Compatibility**: While not a breaking change, it changes test behavior which could impact CI/CD pipelines

## Recommendations

### For Fork Maintainers
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Apply this fix to improve test reliability
   - Run full test suite to identify any newly failing tests
   - Investigate and fix any tests that start failing (they likely indicate real issues)

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Review all usage of `assert_expected_events!` macro in your codebase
   - Ensure tests are correctly expecting the events they should receive
   - Use the improved error messages to debug any test failures

3. **Integration Approach**:
   - This is a safe change that should be included in stable releases
   - Consider it a critical test infrastructure improvement
   - No runtime impact, purely testing framework enhancement

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Watch for any new test failures after integration
   - Treat newly failing tests as potential bug discoveries rather than framework issues
   - Update test assertions if legitimate missing events are identified

This change significantly improves the reliability of the XCM testing framework and should be prioritized for inclusion in fork maintenance updates.
